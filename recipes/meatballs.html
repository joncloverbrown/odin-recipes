        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>These Italian meatballs are very easy to make, and since we skip the messy step of pan-frying the meatballs, it becomes downright simple! Here I use a standard half-beef/half-pork mixture. Once the meatballs are baked, add them to your favorite prepared tomato sauce and simmer for 1 to 2 hours.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>0.33 cup bread crumbs</li>
            <li>0.5 cup milk or beef broth</li>
            <li>2 tsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
            <li>1 lb ground pork</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 tsp parmesan cheese, grated</li>
            <li>0.25 fresh parsely, chopped</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tsp dried Italian herb seasoning</li>
            <li>0.5 tsp red pepper flakes</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cover a baking sheet with foil and spray lightly with cooking spray. Soak bread crumbs in milk in a small bowl for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low and continue cooking and stirring until onion is very tender, about 15 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Gently stir beef and pork together in a large bowl. Add onions, bread crumb mixture, eggs, Parmesan cheese, parsley, garlic, salt, black pepper, Italian herb seasoning, and red pepper flakes; mix together using a rubber spatula until combined. Cover and refrigerate for about one hour.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Form mixture into balls about 1 Â½ inches in diameter; arrange in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned and cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve with your favorite tomato sauce. Enjoy!</li>
